Conan2
======

Conan is an extremely light-weight workflow management application. It is designed to provide a user-friendly interface to interact with various components of the "script-chaining" types workflows that are typical in bioinformatics.

Description
===========

Conan was developed to handle the various loading scenarios and workflows involved in the ArrayExpress and the GXA databases. However, it is available as a standalone tool and can be customised to chain processes (for example, Java processes, perl or shell scripts) together in a resuable way. It is possible to install the Conan web application in your own environments and put together a new workflow with a minimum amount of development.

If you are interested in installing Conan and developing your own processes, see the developer documentation on the Github wiki.
